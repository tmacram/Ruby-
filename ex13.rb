heres, second, third = ARGV

puts "Puts the script is called: #{$0}"
puts "Your first variable is: #{heres}"
puts "Your second variable is: #{second}"
puts "Your third variable is: #{third}"


#Extra Credit
#1. When given less than 3 arguments to my script, the script still ran but the last variable was not taken. Third equaled nothing
#so the output was "Your third variable i: _______"
